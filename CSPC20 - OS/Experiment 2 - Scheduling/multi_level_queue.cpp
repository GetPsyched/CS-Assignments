/*  Multi-Level Queue scheduling algorithm
 *
 *  Definition:
 *
 *  Multi-level queue is not an independent scheduling algorithm.
 *  It makes use of other existing algorithms to group and schedule
 *  jobs with common characteristics.
 *
 *  Points:
 *
 *  - Multiple queues are maintained for processes with common characteristics.
 *  - Each queue can have its own scheduling algorithms.
 *  - Priorities are assigned to each queue.
